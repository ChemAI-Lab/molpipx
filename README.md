</h2>

**MOLPIPx** is a [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-based library that provides an implementation of PIP models compatible with,
1. [FLAX](flax.readthedocs.io/): Neural network library.
2. GPU friendly.
3. Fully differentiable.

## MSA files to JAX ##
This library translates the [MSA](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/bowman/msa/) files, specifically the ``_file_.MONO`` and ``_file_.POLY`` files to the corresponding JAX version, ``_file_mono.py`` and ``_file_poly.py``. 
The MSA files must be generated before, for more information please see https://github.com/szquchen/MSA-2.0

### MSA-JAX files generation ###
MOLPIPx package includes `msa_file_generator`, which translates monomial and polynomial files from MSA to JAX and Rust for molecules.
Check out an [example on generating msa files](https://github.com/ChemAI-Lab/molpipx/tree/main/examples/Data/README.md)


```python
from molpipx import msa_file_generator

head_files = 'MOL_<info>_<deg>'
path = '<path_to_the_files>'
label = '<file_label>'
msa_file_generator(head_files, path, label)
```


The structure of the library is kept simple, as each molecular system could need individual elements. 


## Models ##
MOLPIPx incorporated PIPs with three main regression models, i.e., linear regression, neural networks and Gaussian processes. This library leverages two main automatic differentiation engines, JAX for
The Python version and Enzyme-AD for the Rust version improve the simulation of a wide range of chemical systems.

## Rust Version ##
The Rust version makes use of [std::autodiff](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/autodiff/attr.autodiff.html), an experimental feature of Rust which is currently in the process of upstreaming.
While upstreaming is in progress, you will need to build our custom fork of Rust which already includes autodiff.
Instruction for how to do so are available [here](https://enzyme.mit.edu/index.fcgi/rust/installation.html).
Once upstreaming completed, you will be able to use any nightly Rust version.
This [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/124509) shows the progress in upstreaming the remaining autodiff pieces.
